# Introduction-to-Programming-With-Ruby

Exercises done in [Launch Schools](https://launchschool.com/mastery) Book: [Introduction to Programming With Ruby](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/)

Suggested Way to Organize Code

  - Use one git repository for all exercises in the Ruby book. (Remember: don't nest git repositories.)
  - Create a folder within that repository for each chapter in the book.
  - Create a separate file for every exercise in the chapter.
