=begin 

Take the following array: and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. 
(ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. 
Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.

=end


a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
     'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

arr = a.map do |phrase|
  phrase.split
end

arr.flatten!

p arr
